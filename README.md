# ProximityChat

ProximityChat is a plugin that allows players to chat with players in a certain radius. The further away a player is from another, the different the chat color will be. There is also the option to stop players from chatting with others outside of a defined radius.

Players in the same world will still be subject to the radius, but players in different worlds will be able to see those chat messages regardless of distance. 

This plugin was thrown together in an hour, so it's not perfect. Plugin support will not be provided, but feel free to fork the project and make it better.
